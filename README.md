Internship Task: Content Analysis and Comment Generation Tool 
Introduction: 
As part of our internship program, we are looking for candidates who can develop a content analysis and 
comment generation tool. The tool should be capable of analyzing articles or textual content and 
generating five different types of comments: Friendly, Funny, Congratulating, Questioning, and 
Disagreement. The tool must be built using free and open-source libraries and frameworks, without 
relying on proprietary APIs such as OpenAI. 
Objective: 
The objective of this task is to assess the candidate's ability to: 
1. Develop a text analysis algorithm capable of identifying the tone and sentiment of the provided 
content. 
2. Implement a comment generation mechanism that can produce diverse comments reflecting 
different tones and perspectives. 
3. Utilize free and open-source libraries and frameworks effectively to achieve the desired functionality. 
Requirements: 
1. The tool should accept a piece of text or an article as input. 
2. It should analyze the content to determine its tone and sentiment. 
3. Based on the analysis, the tool should generate five different types of comments: - Friendly: A comment expressing kindness, warmth, or positivity towards the content. - Funny: A humorous or light-hearted comment related to the content. - Congratulating: A comment praising or congratulating the author or subject of the content. - Questioning: A comment raising a question or seeking clarification about the content. - Disagreement: A comment expressing disagreement or a differing opinion regarding the content. 
4. The comments should be coherent, relevant to the content, and grammatically correct. 
5. The tool should be implemented using free and open-source libraries and frameworks, without 
relying on any paid APIs or services.

Deliverables:  
1. Source code of the content analysis and comment generation tool. 
2. Documentation explaining the architecture, algorithms used, and instructions for running the tool. 
3. Video demonstrating working of project. Also, include sample inputs and outputs demonstrating the 
functionality of the tool. 
Evaluation Criteria: 
Candidates will be evaluated based on the following criteria: 
1. Accuracy and effectiveness of the content analysis algorithm. 
2. Diversity and relevance of the generated comments. 
3. Quality and readability of the code. 
4. Compliance with the requirement to use free and open-source libraries and frameworks. 
5. Documentation quality and completeness.
